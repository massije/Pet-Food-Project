## About Wagg

We are a company that provides services for the care of pets first and foremost, but with a primary focus on the pet's well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with work, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time to spend with their pets. This can lead to poor nutrition and long-lasting consequences for pet health. We want to solve this problem by using personalized services for each pet, covering everything from physical to emotional health. Users can use our website to select the diet and purchase the food they like or dislike for their pets. We partner with culinary partners to cook the best food for your pets.
